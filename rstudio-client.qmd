# Installation



# Options

Follow `Tools > Global Options`

- `General`: Check whether you want to save and restore `.Rdata` after and before each session. (No recommended)
- `Code`: choose you favorite pipe operator: `|>` or `%>%` (favor standard pipe `|>`)
- For other options, pick as you like.

{{< fa hand-point-right >}} You can tune options for each RStudio project.


# Goodies

- Rstudio addins
- Customize keyboad shortcuts 
- Code snippets
- Provide helpers when importing novel datasets stored in formats like `csv` that are not self-documented.

# Use {{< fa brands r-project >}} projects

Doing so, `rstudio`

- Automatically sets working directory
- Settles version control options
- Uses `renv` to manage a consistent collection of packages (or not)


# Use {{< fa brands git-alt >}} {{< fa brands git >}}

`rstudio` provides a `git` panel. This is a very convenient way 
of versioning and interacting with remote repositories
